## Description

This is an application used to workout different parts of your body on certain days off the week. After working a specific part of your body, you will be placed on rest to focus on another. As well as the workout routines, our application will also feature an air quality meter for the outdoor enthusiast and a journal log for the user to keep a short description of how the workout made the user feel, physically and mentally.

## Usage

Upon oppening the application, users will first interact with a login in screen. After typing in the necessary information, you will be rerouted to the main page of the application. After logging into the app you will not be required to login for the remainder of the week. Once a user has reached the main page, they can view the air quality API we added to our application as well as choose the part of the body they would like to focus on that day. After selecting your workout for the day, users will have an option to complete some or all provided from a group of 5 randomly generated workouts. After users are comfortable and feel completed with the day's workouts, they will enter a "cooldown" period of three days regarding that specific area of the body, unless the user chooses to override this feature. Once a user hits the "finished" button they will be prompted to make a brief journal entry regardimg how todays workout made them feel.
