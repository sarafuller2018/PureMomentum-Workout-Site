## Description

This is an application used to workout different areas of your body on certain days of the week. After working a specific area of the body, the user will be placed on rest to focus on another. In addition to the workout routines, our application will also feature an air quality meter for the outdoor enthusiast as well as a journal log for the user to keep a short description of how the workout made them feel both physically and mentally.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Upon opening the application, users will first interact with a login screen. After typing in the necessary information, the user will be directed to the main page of the application. After logging into the app, the user will not be required to login for the remainder of the time it is saved into local storage. Once a user has reached the main page, they can view the air quality API we added to our application as well as choose the area they would like to focus on that day. After selecting the workout for the day, users will be provided with 5 randomly generated workouts. When finished, they will enter a "cool down" period of three days for that specific area of the body, unless they choose to override this feature. Once the user hits the "finish" button they will be prompted to make a brief journal entry logging how the workout feedback.
